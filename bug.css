The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you don't carefully consider operator precedence and unit consistency. For instance, using `calc(100% - 50px)` within a nested element might not subtract 50px from the parent's 100%, but rather from the nested element's computed width.  Another issue involves mixing different units.  `calc(100px + 50%)` is valid, but the 50% is relative to the containing element's width, potentially leading to unexpected values.
